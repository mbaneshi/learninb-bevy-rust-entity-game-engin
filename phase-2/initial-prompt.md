Now lets start a exercise journey , we need to cover all provided information in previous part , so we devided them to ten project , each project build upon previous knowledge , we will go from elementry to most advenced , this act as handson learning which adhere to learn by build manifest , so for now think and suggest subject of game , remember our domain is just codebase , what it means , we need create a 2d game which reside in web , and show all information about any codebase . for example when we give system url of any codebase , for instance codebase of linux kernal , it should make game object for any .module , file , internal content in any file , like function data structure , it should creae memeory , and data flow , error handling , so at the end we have intutive analogy or mapping between code and game , we will provide json file , after feeding AST of code to system , that syatem dynamically create game for us , it means any codebase , first go to static analysis nad meta data provided like documentatioon and explanantion of code base , and after that we feed this json which has all needed entity for bevy to dynamically ,provide scene of learning game , i just mentioned this elaboration , so you know wht we are looking for learninf bevy , so you know our domain - as our final presentation is web , so we need asset that was vector based , i mean resilliant for zoom and pan , they can be simple rectangle , square or any other shale , but we need reach ui , wchihc reveal meta data , or button to go deep or reflect meta data , now tell me what you understand , what missin is , and how you can help me , it might be useful , we adjust befor giving back comprehensive prompt like what we did previously
